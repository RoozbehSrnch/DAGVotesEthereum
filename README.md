This repository includes the implementation of the paper "Commitment Attacks on Ethereumâ€™s Reward Mechanism," accepted at the 10th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P) 2025. 

It contains the code for a basic Ethereum implementation and an Ethereum version extended with a DAG votes mechanism.

- To run a local blockchain that mimics the behavior of a basic Ethereum blockchain, run Basic_Ethereum_Bootstrap_Node.py on a single instance, and then run Basic_Ethereum_Normal_Node.py on any other instance that wishes to participate in the local blockchain.

- To run a local blockchain with the DAG votes mechanism, run DAGVotes_Ethereum_Bootstrap_Node.py on a single instance, and then run DAGVotes_Ethereum_Normal_Node.py on any other instance that wishes to participate in the local blockchain.
